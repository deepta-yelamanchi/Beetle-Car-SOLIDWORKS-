# 🚗 Beetle Car – SolidWorks Assembly Project

## Overview

This project is an **independent, beginner-level CAD assembly** created in **SolidWorks** as my first hands-on exploration of the platform. The design is inspired by a classic **Volkswagen Beetle–style car** and was completed to build foundational skills in 3D modeling, part design, and mechanical assembly.

The project emphasizes **learning-by-doing**, creativity, and technical exploration rather than production-level engineering.

---

## Objective

* Learn SolidWorks from the ground up
* Understand how individual parts interact within an assembly
* Practice translating a concept into a structured CAD model
* Build confidence working independently with CAD software

---

## Key Features

* Independent end-to-end project (no templates or guided tutorials)
* Multi-part assembly with proper mating and alignment
* Separate part files for structural and functional components
* Complete technical views, including exploded and sectional drawings

---

## Files & Components

* **Car Frame** – Primary structural body
* **Left Door / Right Door** – Symmetric component design
* **Seats** – Interior modeling practice
* **Wheels** – Reusable rotational component
* **Final Assembly** – Fully constrained SolidWorks assembly
* **Exploded Diagram** – Component relationships and assembly order
* **Sectional View Drawing** – Internal layout visualization

---

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

* SolidWorks part modeling
* Assembly constraints and mates
* Design organization and file structure
* Exploded views and drawing creation
* Independent problem-solving and iteration

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience navigating SolidWorks
* Developed an understanding of CAD workflows
* Improved spatial reasoning and design planning
* Learned how to debug assembly issues independently

---

## Tools Used

* **SolidWorks**

## Notes for Reviewers

This project reflects my **entry point into CAD and mechanical design**. While intentionally simple, it demonstrates initiative, self-directed learning, and my ability to independently learn and apply new technical tools, all skills I aim to continue developing through internships and hands-on engineering experiences.
